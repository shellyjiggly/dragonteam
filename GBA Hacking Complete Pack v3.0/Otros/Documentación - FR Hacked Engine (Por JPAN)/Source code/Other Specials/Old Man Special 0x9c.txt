/*Special 0x9c is a change to the old man battle.

Allows for the old man battle script to be changed
in terms of pokemon caught and level of that pokemon
but the old-man sprite must be changed at the core
level. it is located at 0xe70ec0 at tile molester

The pokemon to be captured must be at 0x8004, with
the lv in 0x8005

Because of limitations on the original code, this 
new version is unable to capture any of the truly
legendary pokemon (like mewtwo or mew, deoxys, 
celebi...) 
oddly enough, the bird trio is allowed, but blissey
isn't...ç
